//! Shuttle's implementation of the [`lazy_static`] crate, v1.4.0.
//!
//! Using this structure, it is possible to have `static`s that require code to be executed at
//! runtime in order to be initialized. Lazy statics should be created with the
//! [`lazy_static!`](crate::lazy_static!) macro.
//!
//! # Warning about drop behavior
//!
//! Shuttle's implementation of `lazy_static` will drop the static value at the end of an execution,
//! and so run the value's [`Drop`] implementation. The actual `lazy_static` crate does not drop the
//! static values, so this difference may cause false positives.
//!
//! To disable the warning printed about this issue, set the `SHUTTLE_SILENCE_WARNINGS` environment
//! variable to any value, or set the [`silence_warnings`](crate::Config::silence_warnings) field of
//! [`Config`](crate::Config) to true.
