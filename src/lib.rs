//! Shuttle is a library for testing concurrent Rust code, heavily inspired by [Loom].
//!
//! Shuttle focuses on unsound systematic testing, rather than the exhaustive testing that Loom
//! offers. This is a soundness--scalability trade-off: Shuttle is not sound (a passing Shuttle test
//! does not prove the code is correct), but it should scale to much larger test cases than Loom.
//! Empirically, systematic testing is successful at finding most concurrency bugs, which tend not
//! to be adversarial.
