# Shuttle support for tokio-stream

This package was derived from tokio-stream by:
1. Copying the source files from the original tokio-stream crate
2. Replacing the tokio dependency with Shuttle's tokio implementation in Cargo.toml
3. Removing extraneous files and dependencies (docs, fuzz tests, CHANGELOG.md, etc.)
